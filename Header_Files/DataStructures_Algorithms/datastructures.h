//This header file includes implementations of useful data structures (such as single linked list, doubly linked list, queue...). I'm using it 
//as a combination for practicing these data structures (never know when a coding interview might be coming up) but also to use in Euler 
//problems. There's been a number of times where I wanted to use a singly linked list in Project Euler questions and have had to make it from 
//scratch so this file will prevent instances like this (I've actually found out recently that C++ has a built in data structure called List
//which uses a doubly linked list structure). Although C++ does feature built-ins for most of these structures, it's good to know the theory
//behind how they work and why each one is useful.
